// playwright development environment setup:

-- ensure node.js installed (node -v & npm -v)
-- initialize project (npm init -y : this will create package.json)
-- npm install -D @playwright/test : install playwright
-- npx playwright install : installl required browser

npm vs npx:
-- npm: node package manager (install, manage packages): installer
-- npx: node package executor: runner

Package Management Fundamentals:
--  package.json: lists dependencies and project metadata.
--  package-lock.json: locks exact versions.
--  node_modules/: actual installed packages.
--  -D (or --save-dev) → for dev dependencies (like test frameworks).
--  npm install <pkg> → adds runtime dependency.
--  npm uninstall <pkg> → removes package.
--  npm run <script> → runs a script defined in package.json.

- create .tests/example.spec.js :(write test script inside it)
-- to execte: npx playwright test :(to run all tests)
-- npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js :(to run specific file)
-- npx playwright test -g "homepage has Playwright in title" :(to run specific test  inside a file)
-- npx playwright show-report :(open test report after run)

why exp.spec.js? what is spec in this?
-- Spec = Specification. (A test file is essentially a specification of how the software should behave)
-- Example: In example.spec.js, you’re writing specs (tests) that describe what the app should do
